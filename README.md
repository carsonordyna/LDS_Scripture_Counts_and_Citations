# **LDS Scripture Data Acquisition & Analysis**
This project provides tools for scraping and processing scripture data and citation patterns in recent General Conference talks of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.

***

## **Contents**

### **Python Scripts and Notebook**

*   **`counts.py`**  
    Scrapes scripture data from [the Church's website](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures?lang=eng) to construct a dataset with total verse counts for each chapter in every book found in the five LDS standard works  

    **Output:**
    *   `VerseCounts.csv`  
    <br>

*   **`citations.py`**  
    Scrapes General Conference talks (both April and October sessions) from [the Church's website](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference) from **the last 10 years** (2016-2025), extracts scripture citations, computes citation frequencies, and retrieves the text for highly cited verses  

    **Outputs:**
    *   `VerseCitations.csv` — Verse references (book-chapter-verse) and citation counts for all verses cited at least once
    *   `Verses.csv` — Verses with **at least 8 citations**, including the text of the verses, their references (book-chapter-verse), the standard work in which they are found, and the total number of verses in the chapter in which the cited verse is found
    
    <br>

*   **`eda.ipynb`**  
    Python notebook for exploratory data analysis of `Verses.csv` and `VerseCounts.csv`

    **Output:**
    *   Summary statistics table and bar plot (in-notebook)

***

### **Data Files**

*   **`VerseCounts.csv`** — Verse counts per chapter for all chapters in each book of each standard work
*   **`VerseCitations.csv`** — Citation frequency for all verses cited at least once in the last 10 years.
*   **`Verses.csv`** — Highly cited verses with their text, reference, and other data

***

### **Configuration**

*   **`pyproject.toml`**  
    Defines project metadata and dependencies

*   **`uv.lock`**  
    Lock file for reproducible environments (generated by `uv`).

***

## **Requirements**

*   **Python 3.11+**
*   Install dependencies using `uv sync` (if using `uv`)


## **Notes**

*   Due to substantial web scraping, expect long runtimes — ***both scripts (`counts.py` and `citations.py`) each take roughly 90 minutes to run.***
*   Code and data can be used for:
    *   Citation trend analysis
    *   Indentification of most quoted verses
    *   Comparing text lengths and/or citation frequencies across different books and/or standard works
